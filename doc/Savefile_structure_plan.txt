Information a savefile has to contain and instructions on where to obtain it.

data taken from:
masses and sizes: https://www.theplanetstoday.com/planets_information_basic_facts.html

locations and velocities: astropy

        planetal locations and velocities defined on 2020-01-01 00:00 from astropy
        example:
        t = Time('2020-01-01 00:00')
        astropy.coordinates.get_body_barycentric_posvel('mercury', t, ephemeris='de432s')[0]
        <CartesianRepresentation (x, y, z) in km
            (-10040366.35598123, -60337800.46906529, -31349011.72097562)>

        planetal velocities eg:
        t = Time('2020-01-01 00:00')
        astropy.coordinates.get_body_barycentric_posvel('sun', t, ephemeris='de432s')[1]
        <CartesianRepresentation (x, y, z) in km / d

#INT version_number file_type

========================
    INT 4.0 Savefile
========================


#WORLD:
    Date of the save and version of the program. "Saved : 2020-01-01 0000"
    Amount of stars in the system "Stars : 1"
    Amount of planets in the system "Planets : 0"
    Planet mass factor (only used in conversion, written here for clarity)


========================
    Saved : 2020-01-01 0000
    Stars : 1
    Planets : 0
    Planet mass factor = *10^24kg
========================

#BDY
    Information about which planets are to be added into the sim.
    Has data about all of their sizes and locations and masses.
    Is used to create the situation in the beginning, before running the program.
    Starts with PLN and number of body, and ends with PLEND
    The info given for each planet should be in format (eg. below is the sun):


========================
    PLN0
    N : SUN
    R : 695700
    M : 1988400.0
    G : 274.68
    C : yellow
    L : 0,0,0
    V : -1249.47638208, -286.99461832, -86.86635069
    PLEND
========================

    Where:
    N is the name of the body,
    R is the radius of the body [km],
    M is the mass of the body later scaled with the mass conversion factor[kg],
    G is the gravitational constant for the planet [m/s^2],
    C is the color of the solar body,
    L is the location of the body given in [km] and in the format x,y,z and
    V is the velocity of the body given in [km/day] and in the format x,y,z

#BDYEND:
    signals to the filereader that the information about the bodies in the world is over


#END:
    Signals to the filereader that the savefile is at the end.


NOTICE:
    When creating your own scenario, it is adviced to follow an example savefile eg. INIT_8 or INIT_2.
    Following an example precisely will make sure that your scenario can actually be loaded into the simulation.
    Pay attention to the units in the INIT file.


Future development:
    - possibility to save data of satellites under SAT0 header in the #BDY section?
    - relatively simple implementation into the loader
    - savefileIO class to save a scenario into a textfile of this format?
